# About naming

In this file I will explain to you the way I name my scripts, functions, classes, variables, etc. so that you can
easily understand their function, form and or anything else that you should know about them.

## About files/scripts

### Their location

Usually you can only find the most important files of a project directly in the "root directory" of it. I try to store
as many as possible in subdirectories but still in a way that makes sense.

### Their names

The name of a file or script is meant to be as obvious to its content or function as possible. Generally I adhere to
the snake case naming convention of files (replacing whitespaces with underscores) or sometimes I replace whitespaces
with dashes. Only seldom I use the camel case naming convention (no spaces between words and every word starts with a
capital letter except the first -> e.g. thatIsAnExampleForCamelCase) for files or scripts.

## About names inside scripts

### General Rules

I name everything except comments and the exception talked below about after the snake case naming convention
(replacing whitespaces with underscores).

#### The Exception of (Py)QT

Functions and classes as well as some imports that are tied to (Py)QT are named not after my normal (and for python
standard) snake case naming convention but after the for C-based programming languages common naming convention of 
camel case (no spaces between words and every word starts with a capital letter except the first -> e.g. 
thatIsAnExampleForCamelCase).
