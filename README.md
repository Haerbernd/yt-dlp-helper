# yt-dlp-helper

yt-dlp-helper is a project which intends to help users use yt-dlp.

## Installation
If you are using Windows simply download the [release .zip file] (https://haerbernd.dev/releases/yt-dlp-helper/yt-dlp-helper_2.0.0-ALPHA.zip) and execute the yt-dlp-helper.exe.<br/>
If you are using Linux or want to use the Python script directly on Windows, download the source code and execute
`install-dependencies[.bat/.sh]` (.bat on Windows, .sh on Linux (don't forget chmod +x "filename")) and afterwards
execute the yt_dlp_helper.py with python.

## Supported OS
Currently, there is only support for Linux and Windows and this will stay like this for quite a while as I neither have
a machine with macOS nor am I willing to test it on a VM and implement it. If you are more willing for this than I am
feel free to add macOS Support and write me, I would gladly link to your work and or include it in this project.

## Personal Update
After quite a few problems with PyCharm and Python 3.12 as well as missing motivation for a few months I finally managed
to add a few important features and functionalities. Also, I finally am motivated again to work on this project so
expect a more frequent updates in the future.
